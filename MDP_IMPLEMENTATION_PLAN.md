# Minimum Demonstrable Product (MDP) Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized tasks and implementation steps for building a Minimum Demonstrable Product that connects the UI and a basic agent workflow for initial alpha testing.

## Prioritized Development Tasks for MDP

**High Priority (Essential for MDP):**

1.  **Define Minimal Backend API**: Design and implement a basic backend API layer with endpoints to trigger a specific, simple agent workflow.
2.  **Select/Adapt a Simple Agent Workflow**: Choose or adapt an existing agent workflow from the `agents/` directory suitable for a basic demonstration.
3.  **Implement UI Interaction for MDP Workflow**: Modify a relevant UI page to make calls to the new backend API endpoint.
4.  **Handle Basic Data Passing (UI -> Backend -> Agent)**: Implement the mechanism for the UI to send input data to the backend, and for the backend to pass this data correctly to the agent workflow.
5.  **Handle Basic Data Passing (Agent -> Backend -> UI)**: Implement the mechanism for the agent workflow to return a simple result, for the backend to receive it, and for the UI to display this result.
6.  **Ensure UI Reflects Agent Identity/Status (Basic)**: Implement basic UI elements to indicate when an agent workflow is in progress and potentially display the agent name.
7.  **Establish Basic Logging**: Integrate a basic logging system in the backend and core agent workflow for debugging.

**Medium Priority (Important for Usability within MDP context):**

8.  **Basic Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling in the backend and UI.
9.  **Refine Data Models for MDP**: Ensure data models for communication are clear and sufficient for the MDP.

**Lower Priority (Defer for post-MDP):**

10. **Full Database Integration**: Defer implementing full persistence.
11. **Comprehensive Agent Orchestration**: Defer complex multi-agent workflows.
12. **Advanced UI Features**: Defer advanced UI elements like dynamic indicators or sidebars.
13. **Full Authentication System**: Use simplified or mock authentication if needed.
14. **Extensive Error Reporting/Monitoring**: Defer detailed reporting systems.

## Implementation Steps for High-Priority Tasks

This plan focuses on building the core functional flow for the MDP:

1.  **Identify a Simple Agent Workflow:**
    *   Review existing Python code in `agents/parent_folder/multi_tool_agent/`.
    *   Choose a simple agent or workflow with clear inputs/outputs.
    *   Pinpoint the specific Python function or class method for its core logic.

2.  **Define and Implement Minimal Backend API:**
    *   Choose a lightweight Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Flask).
    *   Set up a basic backend application structure.
    *   Define a single API endpoint (e.g., `/run-mdp-workflow`) to trigger the agent.
    *   Define expected request and response data structures (e.g., JSON).

3.  **Establish Basic Logging:**
    *   Configure a logging system in the backend application.
    *   Add log statements for requests, agent calls, completion, and errors.

4.  **Connect Backend to Agent Workflow:**
    *   In the backend API endpoint, import necessary Python code from `agents/`.
    *   Write logic to extract input data from the request and pass it to the agent workflow function/method.
    *   Capture the output/result from the agent workflow.

5.  **Implement Basic UI Interaction:**
    *   Identify or create a dedicated React component or page for the MDP.
    *   Add input fields for necessary data.
    *   Include a button to trigger the interaction.
    *   Use `@tanstack/react-query` or `fetch` to send a request to the backend API endpoint.

6.  **Handle Data Passing (End-to-End):**
    *   Ensure UI data matches backend expectations.
    *   Ensure backend correctly extracts and passes data to the agent.
    *   Ensure agent output is correctly received by the backend.
    *   Ensure backend formats agent output for the UI.
    *   In the UI, process the backend response and display the result.

7.  **Ensure Basic UI Reflection of Agent Status:**
    *   Implement state in the React component to track loading status.
    *   Display a loading indicator or disable the button while loading.
    *   Display the result received from the backend.
    *   Occasionally, display the name of the executed agent/workflow.
