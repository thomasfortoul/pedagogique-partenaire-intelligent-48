Here is a rule you can use to guide the development process and ensure consistent, step-by-step progress tracking:

---
**Rule Name:** development_process

**Description:**  
Follow a structured, iterative development process using the project outline and task checklist. Always update the checklist as tasks are completed, and use external documentation as needed.

**Rule Content:**

- Always follow the step-by-step tasks outlined in `tasks.txt`, using `agents.txt` and `prd.txt` for context and requirements. 
- After completing each task, update `tasks.txt` by crossing out (striking through) the finished task.
- Only proceed to the next task after the current one is fully completed and marked as such.
- If additional reference or clarification is needed at any step, use the Perplexity MCP (or equivalent) to consult the most relevant documentation, especially the Google ADK docs.
- **Always refer to [HEC Montr√©al's pedagogical resource](mdc:https:/enseigner.hec.ca/pedagogie) to inform the agent logic, design, and workflow.**
- Maintain a clear, auditable record of progress by keeping `tasks.txt` up to date.
- Do not skip tasks or reorder them unless explicitly instructed.
- Always ensure that the implementation aligns with the requirements and principles described in `project.txt` and `prd.txt`.
