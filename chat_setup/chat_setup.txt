I need to document how the ADK API server and the chat client interact, so the user can apply this to their complex codebase. I'm in Ask mode, so I can't write files, but I can provide a detailed explanation.

# ADK API Server and Chat Client Interaction Documentation

## Overview

The ADK (Agent Development Kit) API server provides a local web server that allows you to test your agent before deployment. The chat client we created simulates a frontend application that communicates with this API server. Here's how the entire system works:

## Setting Up and Running the ADK API Server

1. **Project Structure Requirements**:
   - Your agent code must be in a Python package (a directory with an `__init__.py` file)
   - The directory name is your agent name (e.g., `multi_tool_agent`)
   - The main agent code is typically in `agent.py` within this directory

2. **Starting the API Server**:
   - Navigate to the parent directory containing your agent package
   - Run `adk api_server` from this directory
   - The server will start on http://localhost:8000 by default
   - You should see output similar to:
     ```
     INFO: Started server process [12345]
     INFO: Waiting for application startup.
     INFO: Application startup complete.
     INFO: Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
     ```

3. **Important Note on Directory Structure**:
   - The API server must be able to import your agent as a Python module
   - If you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_agent_name'`, you're likely running the server from the wrong directory

## Using the Chat Client

1. **How the Chat Client Works**:
   - Creates a session with your agent via the `/apps/{agent_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}` endpoint
   - Sends messages to your agent via the `/run` endpoint
   - Processes and displays the agent's responses

2. **API Endpoints and Payload Format**:
   - Session creation: `POST /apps/{agent_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`
   - Message sending: `POST /run`
   - Payload format uses snake_case for field names:
     ```json
     {
       "app_name": "your_agent_name",
       "user_id": "user_id",
       "session_id": "session_id",
       "new_message": {
         "role": "user",
         "parts": [{"text": "your message"}]
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Running the Chat Client**:
   - With the API server running, open a new terminal
   - Run `python3 chat_client.py`
   - Type messages and see your agent's responses

## Applying to Your Complex Codebase

1. **Adapting to Your Project**:
   - Ensure your agent code is in a proper Python package structure
   - The package name should match what you use in the chat client's `AGENT_NAME` variable

2. **Customizing the Chat Client**:
   - Modify the `chat_client.py` script to match your agent's specific requirements
   - You may need to adjust how responses are processed based on your agent's output format

3. **Testing Process**:
   - Always run the API server from the parent directory of your agent package
   - Use the chat client to test different interactions with your agent
   - Check the API server logs for errors if something isn't working

4. **Advanced Usage**:
   - For more complex interactions, you can modify the chat client to handle function calls, streaming responses, or other features
   - The `/run_sse` endpoint can be used for streaming responses if needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Module Not Found Error**:
   - Make sure you're running `adk api_server` from the correct directory
   - Verify your agent package has an `__init__.py` file

2. **API Endpoint Errors**:
   - Check field names in your requests (snake_case vs. camelCase)
   - Ensure all required fields are included in your requests

3. **Agent Execution Errors**:
   - Look at the API server logs for Python exceptions
   - These will help identify issues in your agent's code

By following this documentation, you should be able to adapt the chat client to work with your complex codebase and effectively test your ADK agent locally.
